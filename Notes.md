# Notes

As this is a time-limited practice, I'm trying to focus on the architecture correctness and trying to demo the Android app development essentials, and made choices to fulfill the blurring requirements by  

## The simplest UI:

This surely only covers one possible scenario of people consuming the lunch menu information, but more business logic could be implemented with further clarification with the product people and designers.

## The typical Architecture style:
Not inventing new stuff on top of the well adopted MVVM & UniDirectional Data patterns.

# TODOes:

    ## Functionality:
        - Improve the look & feel -- maybe a whole face-lift with more elaborated Use cases. e.g. menu data availability instead of the hard-coded bi-week rotation.
        - Consume formal menu data. e.g. from some cloud service.
        - consume more details of specific meal, probably with multimedia descriptions.
        - I18N and A11Y for a commercial app. 
        - Offline usage

    ## Non-Functional:
        -  Possible paginated menu data. 
        -  Verify stability
		-  Improve Performance 
		-  more Unit Test and Automation Test
		-  Modularization (app / feature modules)
